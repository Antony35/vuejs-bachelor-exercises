# 00. Introduction to Vue.js Exercises

Welcome to the Vue.js exercises for bachelor students! This introduction will help you understand the course structure and what you'll learn.

## 🎯 Course Objectives

By the end of these exercises, you will be able to:

1. **Build interactive web applications** using Vue.js
2. **Create reusable components** with props and events
3. **Manage application state** with Pinia
4. **Navigate between pages** using Vue Router
5. **Fetch and display data** from APIs
6. **Build a complete mini-project** independently

## 📚 What is Vue.js?

Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It's:
- **Easy to learn**: Especially if you know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Flexible**: Works for small widgets or large applications
- **Reactive**: Automatically updates the UI when data changes
- **Component-based**: Build UIs from reusable pieces

## 🗺️ Course Structure

The exercises are organized into 5 main sections:

### 1. Vue Basics (4 exercises)
Learn the fundamentals: templates, data binding, events, and reactivity.

### 2. Components (4 exercises)
Master component creation, props, events, and slots.

### 3. Routing & State (2 exercises)
Navigate between pages and manage global state.

### 4. API & Async (2 exercises)
Fetch data from external APIs and handle async operations.

### 5. Mini Project (1 exercise)
Apply everything you've learned to build a dashboard application.

## 📖 How to Use These Exercises

### Before Each Exercise:
1. Read the entire README first
2. Understand what you're supposed to build
3. Check the "Expected Outcome" section

### During the Exercise:
1. Write code yourself (don't copy-paste blindly)
2. Test frequently as you build
3. Use `console.log()` to debug
4. Read error messages carefully

### After Each Exercise:
1. Compare your solution with the requirements
2. Test all functionality
3. Try to add one extra feature on your own
4. Reflect on what you learned

## 🛠️ Tools You'll Use

- **VS Code**: Code editor (recommended)
- **Node.js & NPM**: JavaScript runtime and package manager
- **Vite**: Fast development server
- **Vue DevTools**: Browser extension for debugging

## 💡 Learning Tips

1. **Practice consistently**: Code a little every day
2. **Understand, don't memorize**: Know why, not just how
3. **Experiment**: Break things and fix them
4. **Read documentation**: [vuejs.org](https://vuejs.org/) is your friend
5. **Ask questions**: Don't stay stuck for hours
6. **Collaborate**: Discuss with classmates, but code yourself

## 📝 Assessment Approach

These exercises are designed to:
- Build progressively on each other
- Give you hands-on experience
- Prepare you for real-world Vue.js development
- Culminate in an independent mini-project

The final mini-project (Exercise 13) will have minimal instructions to test your autonomy and problem-solving skills.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Make sure you've completed the installation steps in the [main README](../README.md)
2. Start with [Exercise 01: Hello Vue](../01-vue-basics/ex01-hello-vue/)
3. Work through exercises sequentially
4. Don't skip exercises—each builds on previous knowledge

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Can I use Vue 2 instead of Vue 3?**  
A: These exercises are designed for Vue 3 (Composition API). Vue 3 is the current standard.

**Q: Do I need to know TypeScript?**  
A: No, we'll use JavaScript. TypeScript is optional.

**Q: How long should each exercise take?**  
A: Early exercises: 1-2 hours. Later exercises: 2-4 hours. Mini project: 8-12 hours.

**Q: Can I work in groups?**  
A: Discuss concepts together, but write your own code individually.

**Q: What if I get stuck?**  
A: 1) Read the error message, 2) Check Vue docs, 3) Use console.log, 4) Ask classmates/instructor.

## 🎓 Expected Outcomes

By completing these exercises, you'll have:
- A strong foundation in Vue.js development
- A portfolio of 13 projects to showcase
- The skills to build your own Vue.js applications
- Confidence to learn advanced Vue.js topics independently
